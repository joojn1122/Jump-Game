### Simple Jump Game using SDL2


```
I know its really bad but it's my first time creating guis in C++ :)

It also allocates a lot of memory and even more when you continue to play,
I tried adding delete on unused objects but it eventually crashed..

I only created this to learn more C++, also I might create a video about this
```

You can download it [here](../../releases) (windows only)
